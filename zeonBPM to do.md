# Items


Changed all PRF to be chapter uses instead of breakable, can be reversed if needed



## Swords

### Standard
    made levin/flame into improved light brands(magic swords)
    flame sword is good vs horse(beast)
### Blades
    made all attack last and shove
    added brave blade
### Katanas
    wo dao, scimitar and laguz sword
    40 crit, low mt
    require katana tag to use
### Daggers
    added a shitton of daggers
    stats are roughly based on engage, with -1mt and +10 crit
    shove daggers and killer dagger are 1 range, all others are 1-2 range
    took some liberties making them
    need to make an S rank one, and 2 extra shove daggers(i dont why but dark asked for 4 push daggers)
    only magic dagger is the A rank flame dagger, should probably add a C rank one(runed dagger)
### PRF
    Doomblade       no idea what this is
    Rune dagger     for ariel, will make it a magic dagger around B rank

## Lances

### Standard

### Greatlances(should rename to pikes)
    all attack last and shove

### Javelins
    All 1-2 range
    should make a magic one for the lolz
### PRF


## Axes

### Standard

### Greataxes(should think of a better name)
    all attack last and shove
    moved battle axe here

### Hatchets
    all 1-2 range
### PRF
    none so far

## Bows
    all are 2-3 range now
    did not touch anything else yet
    would like to make a magic bow
### Standard

### Ballistas

### PRF


## Anima
    divided into 5 main elements

    Excalibur S rank, will probably make wind or smt
    Holy Fire   Reaver arcfire
    All S tomes gives +5 in a stat, matching Excalibur, wind tome is +10avo instead
### Fire
    fire magic has nothing special for it, but so far its good enough
    made scorch into a short range high damage tome
    meteor does friendly fire(i find it fitting)
### Thunder
    they paralyze(-1 MOV)
### Wind
    eff vs flying
    wind magic is good as is currently
### Ice
    ice debuffs spd
    it could have another spell but not totally neccesary
### Earth

    hits DEF
    added an A rank tome that ignores triangle

### PRF
    dawnfire    emma
    black flame counts as dark for magic triangle, E wind stats

## Light
~~has lots of duplicate spells, will change effect of those~~ done
### Standard

### Special


## Dark
has a fuckton of spells, will have to think of new effects for variety
### Standard 

### Special
dark spikes is a 2 range 2 aoe

## Fist
    9 total fists, should probably add an S one, and maybe a PRF one
    all are brave
    made them heavy and hard hitting, will probably brutally maul everyone you put them against

## Monster
    should probably merge this with fists to have less headaches in the future
